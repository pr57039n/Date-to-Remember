# Date-to-Remember
See if your date is successful.

## Usage
Currently, open the .py script with something like Visual studio code and run it from there.
Alternatively run it through notepad++ or python itself.

### Testimonies
Varied resullts from people who may not understand second dates are never guaranteed!
```
My date ended in failure I thought I did everything right
```
Or even
```
I thought I had money but gas was expensive...
```
Try your luck! Maybe it'll work out!
